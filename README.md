#### 1.- Project creation and data reading and processing


The data file for the assignment has been downloaded to my download folder.
The code segment below will use ProjectTemplate library to create a set if folders for this project, 
copy the file to the data folder and unzip it, then it reads the data into 'repdata' object
#### work dir has to be modified to fit your system. The rest pends from it, so it should work
There is the Rmd file and an html file. Since github doesn't allow the visualization of big files, 
and this one has graphic images and  it's 1.5MB, you have to download it first and then open it to view
it as intended.
Also, you can replicate it by running the Rmd file, once you modify the working dir
